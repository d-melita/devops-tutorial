### Congratulations!

You have successfully set up Loki and Grafana to visualize and monitor logs.
You have learned how to query logs in Loki, create a dashboard in Grafana,
and set up alerts to notify you when specific log messages are detected.
This will help you to quickly identify issues and take action when necessary.
You can further customize the dashboard and alerts by adding more panels, queries,
and visualizations.
You can either create more alerts or customize the existing ones to better suit your needs.

Grafana is a powerful tool that allows you to visualize and monitor logs, metrics,
and other data sources.
You can explore more features and integrations to create custom dashboards and alerts that
meet your requirements.
We truly recommend you to explore the Grafana documentation and community to learn more
about its capabilities and how you can leverage them to monitor and analyze your data
effectively.

### Next Steps

Now that you have finished this tutorial, you can give the following additional tasks a try,
at your own pace. These are just ideas that might be interesting for you.

- Visualize logs with other types of panels (e.g., Time Series, Stat, etc.);
- Add a second application and distinguish between the two in the dashboard;
- Setup more realistic contact points (if you haven't already);
- Add alert when no logs are received in a certain time frame (i.e., for detecting if the
  app and/or Promtail is down);
